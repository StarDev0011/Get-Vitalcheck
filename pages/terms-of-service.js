					<h2>VitalCheck-Doctors In Your Office</h2>
					<h3><span style={{color: '#2d3390'}}>Terms of Service</span></h3>
					<h6>September 20, 2020</h6>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>As part of the VitalCheck-Doctors In Your Office Program (the “Program”), Klarion Wellness, Inc.,
						the administrative agent for  the Program (<strong>“Klarion Wellness”</strong>), will arrange 
						appointments for you at your place of work or other designated location or via a telemedicine
						appointment with health care providers retained by ED Medical, P.C., a New Jersey medical
						practice (<strong>“ED Medical”)</strong>, as independent contractors (each, a
						<strong>“Healthcare Provider”</strong>) to provide you with medical services (“Medical
						Services”), which may include an annual wellness examination and other medical examinations and
						tests, and related medical, diagnostic and preventive health services to detect and prevent
						illness, disease and other health related problems (<strong>“Medical Services”</strong>). In
						addition, Klarion Wellness will manage, forward and share your health history forms and other
						health-related information with ED Medical and the Healthcare Providers or with yourself via an
						online patient portal. Klarion Wellness may also provide other administrative services to ED
						Medical and the Healthcare Providers as administrative agent for the Program (such services are
						referred to herein as the “Services”).</p>
					<p>As part of its Administrative Services, Klarion Wellness provides you with access to our
						proprietary technology platform and an interactive website (the “Platform”). Use of the Platform
						and our website(s) at klarionwellness.com, doctorsintheoffice.com, getvitalcheck.com
						(collectively, the “Services”) is governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
						Platform  (which includes content) is intended for access and use only by U.S. customers. Please
						read these terms and conditions of use (the “Agreement”) carefully before accessing or using the
						Platform. Throughout this Agreement, Klarion Wellness is referred to as “we” or “us.”</p>
					<h4>General Terms and Conditions</h4>
					<p>By accessing or using the Platform and the Services , you agree to be bound by this Agreement as
						posted and accessible through our Platform or website at the time of your access or use and to
						use the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, our <Link href = "/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link> and any additional terms and
						conditions that are referenced herein or that otherwise may apply to specific features of the
						Services, or to products or services that we make available to you through the Services (all of
						which are deemed part of this Agreement). If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of use
						for the Services as set forth in this Agreement, you may not use the Services.</p>
					<p>The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change the terms of this Agreement in the future, we
						will post the revised Terms and Conditions of Use through our Platform or website and update the
						“Last Revised” date, below, to reflect the date of the changes. You agree to review these Terms
						and Conditions of Use each time you use the Services so that you are aware of any modifications
						made to this Agreement. By continuing to access or use the Services after we post such changes,
						you agree to the terms of this Agreement, as modified.</p>
					<h4>What Service does Klarion Wellness Provide?</h4>
					<p>The Services are designed to offer information and a means to enable you to obtain telephonic,
						email, electronic messaging, SMS and in-person consultations and treatment by facilitating the
						connection and communication between you and the Healthcare Providers. For the avoidance of
						doubt, the capitalized word “Services” as used in this Agreement refers only to our Platform,
						website and related content and does not refer to the in-person consultations, treatment or the
						content of communications that users receive from Healthcare Providers.</p>
					<p>When you use action-oriented features on Klarion Wellness you agree that Klarion Wellness may
						send you automatically via e-mail, mobile telephone or other contact information provided by you
						in your account settings, content including but not limited to, reminders relating to health
						checklists or doctor recommended actions for you. As a result, the content in those reminders
						may contain protected health information under HIPAA, including content related to conditions,
						treatments, and medications. You understand and agree that by using these features, you are
						opting into receiving your own protected health information by email, SMS or mobile telephone
						notification, which is not secure. You also understand and agree that by receiving such
						protected health information by e-mail, SMS or mobile telephone notification, you will be
						charged by your wireless or internet provider and that such e-mails, SMS or mobile telephone
						notification may be generated by an automated dialing system.</p>
					<h4>How to Use the Platform?</h4>
					<p>To use the Platform, you first need to sign up with Klarion Wellness. When signing up, you are
						obligated to provide us with certain information, such as your name, address, date of birth,
						email address and insurance information. Upon successful completion of the sign up process, we
						will provide you with a personal account, accessible for you via a password-protected link in
						your inbox or via a password of your choice.</p>
					<p>You have to be 18 years of age or older and reside in a jurisdiction in which we offer the
						Platform to use the Platform. If you reside in a jurisdiction that restricts the use of the
						Platform because of age, or restricts the ability to enter into contracts such as this one due
						to age, you must abide by such age limits and you must not use the Platform. You represent that
						you are of legal age to enter into a binding contract.</p>
					<p>The Platform is designed to enable you to book an appointment for non-emergency medical
						consultation services with a Healthcare Provider arranged by ED Medical and Klarion. After your
						booking, the Platform will book the appointment for you to see a Healthcare Provide at the
						appointed time and place or by telephone or video. After the appointment with the Healthcare
						Provider, the Platform prepares the claim for submission by ED Medical to your insurance
						carrier.</p>
					<p>You understand that you should never delay seeking advice from your primary care physician or
						other health professionals due to information provided by the Healthcare Provider either
						in-person or through the Klarion Wellness Services. You agree to seek emergency help when
						needed, and continue to consult with your primary care physician or a specialist as recommended
						by the healthcare provider and by your primary care physician.</p>
					<p>You understand that if your medical condition warrants emergency help, the Healthcare Provider
						will direct you to the nearest local hospital emergency department or emergency room.</p>
					<p>Klarion Wellness is the provider of certain administrative services to the Healthcare Provider
						and does not provide professional medical services.</p>
					<p>Klarion Wellness is not a healthcare provider and does not practice medicine and does  not
						participate in or interfere with the practice of medicine by the Healthcare Providers either
						in-person or via Klarion Wellness Services. Each Healthcare Provider is responsible for his or
						her services and compliance with the requirements applicable to his or her profession and
						license.</p>
					<p>In the event that a Healthcare Provider recommends that seek further evaluation or treatment from
						your primary care physician or from a specialist, you agree to consult with your primary care
						physician or a specialist in person for follow-up treatment; and/or seek treatment, if
						necessary, at a local hospital emergency department.</p>
					<p><strong>KLARION WELLNESS IS NOT ENGAGED IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL
							SERVICES, AND IS NOT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER WITH WHICH YOU
							ESTABLISH A TREATMENT RELATIONSHIP IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING YOU WITH MEDICAL
							SERVICES. WE ONLY ACT AS A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES TO THE
							PROGRAM AND CONNECT YOU WITH A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER .</strong></p>
					<p>You are entering into a physician-patient relationship with the Healthcare Provider.</p>
					<p>You understand that you should never delay seeking advice from your primary care physician or
						other health professionals due to information provided by a Healthcare Provider through Klarion
						Wellness. You agree to seek emergency help when needed, and continue to consult with your
						primary care physician as recommended by the Healthcare Provider and by your primary care
						physician.</p>
					<p>You understand and agree that a consultation of the Healthcare Provider with another healthcare
						professional may involve the communication of your medical information, both orally and
						visually, to physicians and other health care practitioners located in other parts of the
						state/jurisdiction or outside of the state/jurisdiction.</p>
					<p>You represent and warrant to us that, to the extent you enter “protected health information” (as
						such term is defined under HIPAA) for a third person, you are legally authorized to do so on
						behalf of such third person, and such third person has validly consented to your inputting of,
						and your review of, “protected health information” of such third person on Klarion Wellness
						website and mobile apps.</p>
					<h4>Your Use of the Services</h4>

						acknowledge and agree that we are entitled at all times to verify the information provided and
						to deny your use of the Services at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>
					<p>You may only access the Services using authorized means. It is your responsibility to check to
						ensure you download the correct Platform for your device. We are not liable if you do not have a
						compatible device or if you download the wrong version of the Platform for your device.</p>

						imply any sponsorship of your website or service by us or by our Services. However, you may not,
						without our prior written permission, frame or inline link any of the content of our Services,
						or incorporate into another website or other service any of our material, content or
						intellectual property.</p>
					<h4>Payment</h4>

						be charged only when you actually use the Services. ED Medical and Klarion Wellness shall, on
						behalf of the Healthcare Provider, charge your insurance carrier or your employer for the
						medical services provided to you by that Healthcare Provider. The insurance carrier’s or
						employer’s payment for the medical services will be paid directly to ED Medical and includes a
						portion that is retained by us for our Services in connection with the Program.</p>
					<p>You agree that you consent to the Healthcare Provider either billing your insurance carrier or
						your employer for medical services rendered or engaging Klarion Wellness or another entity to
						bill your insurance carrier on behalf of the Healthcare Provider for the medical services . You
						agree that a representative of ED Medical or Klarion Wellness or any other entity appointed by
						one of them can contact your insurance carrier on your behalf as your proxy to determine your
						eligibility for the Medical Services and insurance benefits. You agree that any payment made by
						your insurance carrier or employer is non-refundable.</p>
					<p>We may also use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to link us to your
						insurance carrier. The processing of payments, as applicable, in connection with your use of the
						Platform will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor
						in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor.

						of a telephonic, email, electronic messaging, SMS and in-person communications and consultations
						with a Healthcare Provider), Klarion Wellness will obtain certain transaction details, which we
						will use solely in accordance with our <Link href = "/privacy-policy">Privacy

					<h4>Klarion Wellness Arbitration Agreement</h4>
					<h5>Summary</h5>
					<p><strong> </strong>Klarion Wellness’s Terms of Use require the use of arbitration to resolve
						disputes and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. Most concerns
						can be resolved quickly by contacting our support department at
						customer-support@getvitalcheck.com . In the unlikely event that our support team is unable to
						resolve a legitimate legal complaint you may have (or if Klarion Wellness has not been able to
						resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to
						resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims instead of in courts of
						general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
						neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court,
						and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and
						relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an
						individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. We request that you
						work with us to resolve any disputes for 30 days after notifying us of such issues before filing
						arbitration.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><u>Choice of Law; Arbitration Clause and Class Action Waiver – Important – Please Review
								as This Affects Your Legal Rights</u></strong></p>
					<p>This Agreement shall be deemed to have been entered into and shall be construed and enforced in
						accordance with the laws of the State of New York as applied to contracts made and to be
						performed entirely within New York, without giving effect to the state’s conflicts of law
						statute. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A
						THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES
						RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM OR THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY
						AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN
						ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION&#8217;S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND
						WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action
						or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this Agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE WAIVING
						THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY
						HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL
						ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general
						or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person&#8217;s account, if
						we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the
						Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. Judgment on the award
						rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any
						provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award
						damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service.</p>
					<h4>Opt-Out Procedure</h4>
					<p>The Opt-Out deadline for opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has passed.</p>
					<p>CLAIMS ARE TIME-BARRED. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary or the
						applicable dispute resolution process, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of
						or related to use of the Service or otherwise under these must be filed within one (1) year
						after such claim or cause of action arose or you hereby agree to be forever barred from bringing
						such claim.</p>
					<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
					<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to the subject
						matter contained in this Agreement and supersede all previous and contemporaneous agreements,
						proposals and communications, written or oral, related to that subject matter. This Agreement
						will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without
						regard to any conflicts of law provisions contained therein.</p>
					<p>This Agreement is personal to you and you may not assign it to anyone. If any provision of this
						Agreement is found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision
						will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability
						of any remaining provisions. This Agreement is not intended to benefit any third party, and do
						not create any third party beneficiaries. Accordingly, this Agreement may only be invoked or
						enforced by you or us. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
						claim or cause of action that you may have arising out of or related to use of the Services or
						this Agreement must be filed by you within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or
						be forever barred. Any and all provisions of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
						be performed after the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive and be
						enforceable after such termination or expiration including, without limitation, provisions
						relating to ownership, indemnification, limitation of liability and governing law.</p>
