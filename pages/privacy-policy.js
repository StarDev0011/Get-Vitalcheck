					<h3><span style={{color: '#2d3390'}}>Privacy Policy</span></h3>
					<h6>September 14, 2020</h6>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
					<p>As part of the VitalCheck-Doctors In Your Office Program (the “Program”), Klarion Wellness, Inc.,
						the administrative agent for  the Program (<strong>“Klarion Wellness”</strong>), will arrange 
						appointments for you at your place of work or other designated location or via a telemedicine
						appointment with health care providers retained by ED Medical, P.C., a New Jersey medical
						practice (<strong>“ED Medical”)</strong>, as independent contractors (each, a
						<strong>“Healthcare Provider”</strong>) to provide you with medical services (“Medical
						Services”), which may include an annual wellness examination and other medical examinations and
						tests, and related medical, diagnostic and preventive health services to detect and prevent
						illness, disease and other health related problems (<strong>“Medical Services”</strong>). In
						addition, Klarion Wellness will manage, forward and share your health history forms and other
						health-related information with ED Medical and the Healthcare Providers or with yourself via an
						online patient portal. Klarion Wellness may also provide other administrative services to ED
						Medical and the Healthcare Providers as administrative agent for the Program (such services are
						referred to herein as the “Services”).</p>
					<p>As part of its Administrative Services, Klarion Wellness provides you with access to our
						proprietary technology platform and an interactive website (the “Platform”). Klarion Wellness,
						Inc. (“us,” “we,” or “<strong>Klarion Wellness</strong>”) is committed to respecting the privacy
						rights of our customers, visitors, and other users of klarionwellness.com,
						doctorsintheoffice.com, getvitalcheck.com (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and related websites,
						Platforms, services and mobile Platforms provided by Klarion Wellness and on/in which this
						Privacy Policy is posted or referenced (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). We
						created this Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) to give you confidence as you
						use the Services and to demonstrate our commitment to the protection of privacy. This Privacy
						Policy is only applicable to the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other
						website or digital service that you may be able to access through the Services or any website or
						digital services of Klarion Wellness’s business partners, each of which may have data
						collection, storage and use practices and policies that may materially differ from this Privacy
						Policy. Your use of the Services is governed by this Privacy Policy and the Agreement (as the
						term “Agreement” is defined in our Terms of Use). Any capitalized term used but not defined in
						this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning in the Agreement.</p>
					<p>BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY
						AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN
						THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU CANNOT USE THE SERVICES.
						IF YOU USE THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE (SUCH AS YOUR CHILD) OR AN ENTITY (SUCH AS
						YOUR EMPLOYER), YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED BY SUCH INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO ACCEPT
						THIS PRIVACY POLICY ON SUCH INDIVIDUAL&#8217;S OR ENTITY&#8217;S BEHALF.</p>
					<h4>2. Information We Collect</h4>
					<h5>2.1 Personal Information</h5>
					<h5>2.1.1 Personal Information Generally</h5>
					<p>Some of the Services require us to know more about you so that we can best meet your needs. When
						you access these Services, we may ask you to voluntarily provide us certain information that
						personally identifies (or could be used to personally identify) you (“<strong>Personal
							Information</strong>”). Personal Information includes (but is not limited to) the following
						categories of information: (1) contact data (such as your e-mail address and phone number); (2)
						demographic data (such as your gender, your date of birth and your zip code); (3) insurance data
						(such as your insurance carrier, insurance plan, member ID, group ID and payer ID); (4) medical
						data (such as the doctors, dentists or other health care providers (“<strong>Your</strong>
						<strong>Healthcare Providers</strong>”) you have visited, your reasons for visit, your dates of
						visit, your medical history, and other medical and health information you choose to share with
						us), and (5) other information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, including without
						limitation SSN, unique identifiers such as passwords, and Personal Information in emails or
						letters that you send to us. You may still access and use some of the Services if you choose not
						to provide us with any Personal Information, but the features of the Services that require your
						Personal Information will not be accessible to you.</p>
					<h5>2.1.2 Billing, Collection and Payment Information</h5>
					<p>When we process an insurance claim for medical services on behalf of a Healthcare Provider, your
						insurance information is processed by us or by our payment processing partner, if we appoint
						one. We or our payment processing partner collects your voluntarily provided Personal
						Information to process the insurance claim. Our payment processing partner’s use and storage of
						information is governed by their applicable terms of service and privacy policy.</p>
					<h5>2.2 Traffic Data</h5>
					<p>We also may automatically collect certain data when you use the Services, such as (1) IP address;
						(2) domain server; (3) type of device(s) used to access the Services; (4) web browser(s) used to
						access the Services; (5) referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the
						Services; (6) geolocation information; and (7) other statistics and information associated with
						the interaction between your browser or device and the Services (collectively “<strong>Traffic
							Data</strong>”). Depending on applicable law, some Traffic Data may be Personal Information.
					</p>
					<p>We may also collect additional information, which may be Personal Information, as otherwise
						described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.</p>
					<h5>2.3 HIPAA and PHI</h5>
					<p>Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
						(“<strong>HIPAA</strong>”), some of the demographic, health and/or health-related information
						that Klarion Wellness collects as part of providing the Services may be considered “protected
						health information” or “<strong>PHI</strong>”. Specifically, when Klarion Wellness receives
						identifiable information about you from or on behalf of Healthcare Providers who have provided
						you with Medical Services, this information is PHI. HIPAA provides specific protections for the
						privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. Klarion Wellness may
						only use and disclose your PHI in the ways permitted by the Healthcare Provider(s). In addition,
						you have been or will be asked to e-sign the Klarion Wellness User Authorization (the
						“<strong>Insurance Consent and HIPAA Authorization</strong>”). Your decision to e-sign the
						Klarion Wellness Authorization is entirely voluntary. If you choose to e-sign the Klarion
						Wellness Authorization, you agree that Klarion Wellness may use and disclose your PHI in the
						same way it uses and discloses your Personal Information that is not PHI. These uses and
						disclosures are described in this Privacy Policy. To the extent any provision in the Klarion
						Wellness Authorization is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or other provisions of the
						Agreement, then the provision in the Klarion Wellness Authorization only controls with respect
						to your PHI. If you do not e-sign the Klarion Wellness Authorization, then your Personal
						Information that is not PHI is governed by this Privacy Policy and your Personal Information
						that is PHI is used and disclosed only as permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s).</p>
					<h4>3. How We Collect Information</h4>
					<p>We collect information (including Personal Information and Traffic Data) when you use and
						interact with the Services, and in some cases from third party sources. Such information
						includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li> When you use the Services’ interactive tools and services, making an appointment with a
							designated Healthcare Provider and completing medical history forms (&#8220;<strong>Medical
								History Forms</strong>&#8220;) prior to Healthcare Provider appointments;</li>
						<li> When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Services and
							through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like;</li>
						<li>If you use the Platform and software we make available, we may receive and collect
							information transmitted from your computing device for the purpose of providing you the
							relevant Services, such as information that lets Klarion Wellness know when you are logged
							on and available to receive update or alert notices;</li>
						<li>If we develop and you download our mobile Platform, we may receive information about your
							location and mobile device;</li>
						<li>Through cookies, web beacons, website analytics services and other tracking technology
							(collectively, “<strong>Tracking Tools</strong>”), as described below; and</li>
						<li>When you use the “Contact Us” function on the Site, send us an email or otherwise contact
							us.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>4. Tracking Tools and “Do Not Track”</h4>
					<h5>4.1. Tracking Tools</h5>
					<p>We may use tools outlined below in order to better understand users.</p>
					<p style={{paddingLeft: 40+'px'}}><strong>Cookies: </strong>“Cookies” are small computer files
						transferred to your computing device that contain information such as user ID, user preferences,
						lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Services. We use Cookies to help
						us improve or tailor the Services by tracking your navigation habits, storing your
						authentication status so you do not have to re-enter your credentials each time you use the
						Services, customizing your experience with the Services and for analytics and fraud prevention.
					</p>
					<p>We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral
						advertising. This means that some of our business partners use Cookies to display Klarion
						Wellness ads on other websites and services based on information about your use of the Services
						and on your interests (as inferred from your online activity). Other Cookies used by our
						business partners may collect information when you use the Services, such as the IP address,
						mobile device ID, operating system, browser, web page interactions, the geographic location of
						your internet service provider and demographic information, such as gender and age range. These
						Cookies help Klarion Wellness learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.
					</p>
					<p>For more information on cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
					<p style={{paddingLeft: 40+'px'}}><strong>Web Beacons: </strong>“Web Beacons” (a.k.a. clear GIFs or
						pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that may be used to
						collect anonymous information about your use of our Services, the websites of selected
						advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send you. The information
						collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using the
						selected advertisers&#8217; websites or opening our emails, and for what purpose, and also
						allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising.</p>
					<p style={{paddingLeft: 40+'px'}}><strong>Website Analytics: </strong>We may use third-party website
						analytics services in connection with the Services, including, for example, to register mouse
						clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text that you type into the Site. These website
						analytics services generally do not collect Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide
						it and generally do not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use their
						services. We use the information collected from these services to help make the Services easier
						to use and as otherwise set forth in Section 6 (Use of Information).</p>
					<p style={{paddingLeft: 40+'px'}}><strong>Mobile Device Identifiers: </strong>Mobile device identifiers
						are data stored on your mobile device that may track mobile device and data and activities
						occurring on and through it, as well as the Platforms installed on it. Mobile device identifiers
						enable collection of Personal Information (such as media access control, address and location)
						and Traffic Data. As with other Tracking Tools, mobile device identifiers help Klarion Wellness
						learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.</p>
					<h5>4.2. Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers</h5>
					<p>Some web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) allow you to reject Cookies or to alert
						you when a Cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. You may be able to reject
						mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although
						you are not required to accept Klarion Wellness’s Cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you
						block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.
					</p>
					<p>You may opt out of receiving certain Cookies and certain trackers by visiting the Network
						Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) consumer
						opt-out page. When you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your
						computer or tablet indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from
						NAI or DAA member companies. If you delete Cookies on your computer or tablet, you may need to
						opt out again. For information about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile
						device identifiers, please
						visit http://www.Platformprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device.
						Please note that even after opting out of interest-based advertising, you may still see Klarion
						Wellness’s advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you). Also,
						opting out does not mean that Klarion Wellness is no longer using Tracking Tools &#8212; Klarion
						Wellness still may collect information about your use of the Services even after you have opted
						out of interest-based advertisements and may still serve advertisements to you via the Services
						based on information it collects via the Services.</p>
					<h5>4.3. How Klarion Wellness Responds to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals</h5>
					<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not
						Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have
						his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website operator elects to respond to a
						particular DNT signal, the website operator may refrain from collecting certain Personal
						Information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently
						no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website
						operators, including Klarion Wellness, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more
						information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.</p>
					<h4>5. Use of Information</h4>
					<p>We use your information, including Personal Information, to provide the Services to you and to
						help improve them, including to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>provide you with the products, services and information you request and respond to
							correspondence that we receive from you;</li>
						<li>provide, maintain, administer or expand the Services, perform business analyses, or for
							other internal purposes to support, improve or enhance our business, the Services, and other
							products and services we offer;</li>
						<li>send you information about Klarion Wellness or our products or Services;</li>
						<li>contact you when necessary or requested, including to remind you of an upcoming appointment;
						</li>
						<li>customize and tailor your experience of the Services, which may include sending customized
							messages or showing you Sponsored Results that may be of interest to you based on
							information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy;</li>
						<li>send emails and other communications that display content that we think will interest you
							and according to your preferences;</li>
						<li>combine information received from third parties with the information that we have from or
							about you and use the combined information for any of the purposes described in this Privacy
							Policy;</li>
						<li>use statistical information that we collect in any way permitted by law, including from
							third parties in connection with their commercial and marketing efforts; and</li>
						<li>prevent, detect and investigate security breaches and potentially illegal or prohibited
							activities.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We may use information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI Personal
						Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) to better understand who uses Klarion
						Wellness and how we can deliver a better healthcare experience (for example, testing different
						kinds of emails has helped us understand when and how patients prefer to get Wellness Reminders
						for preventive care), or otherwise at our discretion.</p>
					<h4>6. Disclosure of Information</h4>
					<p>We may disclose certain information that we collect from you:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers with whom you schedule an
							appointment through the Platform. For example, if you complete a Medical History Form using
							the Platform in advance of an appointment, we will share your Medical History Form with the
							Healthcare Provider with whom you make the appointment.</li>
						<li>We may share your Personal Information with the Healthcare Provider with whom you make the
							appointment to enable them to refer you to and make appointments with other healthcare
							providers on your behalf or to perform analyses on potential health issues or treatments,
							provided that you choose to use the applicable Services.</li>
						<li>We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers in the event of an
							emergency.</li>
						<li>We may also share your Personal Information with organizations that collect, aggregate and
							organize your information so they can make it more easily accessible to your Healthcare
							Providers.</li>
						<li>We do not sell email addresses to third parties. We may share your email address with our
							business partners to enable them to help Klarion Wellness customize our advertising.</li>
						<li>We may share your Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who
							perform core operational services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, data storage,
							security, insurance verification, or Website analytics set forth in Section 4.1 (Tracking
							Tools)) and/or by making certain features available to our users.</li>
						<li>For the purposes of determining eligibility and cost-sharing obligations, and otherwise
							obtaining benefit plan information, we may share with the insurance provider you identify to
							us (via our business partners) your insurance-related Personal Information.</li>
						<li>We may transfer your information to another company in connection with a merger, sale,
							acquisition or other change of ownership or control by or of Klarion Wellness (whether in
							whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to
							notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security
							policies and practices.</li>
						<li>We also may need to disclose your Personal Information or any other information we collect
							about you if we determine in good faith that such disclosure is needed to: (1) comply with
							applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights,
							property or safety of Klarion Wellness or another party; (3) enforce the Agreement or other
							agreements with you; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates
							third-party rights.</li>
						<li>We may disclose information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI
							Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) at our discretion.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We store and process your information on our servers in the United States. We maintain industry
						standard backup and archival systems.</p>
					<h4>7. Public Information</h4>
					<p>Any information that you may reveal in a review posting or online discussion or forum is
						intentionally open to the public and is not in any way private. We recommend that you carefully
						consider whether to disclose any Personal Information in any public posting or forum. What you
						have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we
						are unable to control or predict.</p>
					<h4>8. Storage and Security of Information</h4>
					<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We endeavor to follow generally
						accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during
						transmission and in storage. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our Site, we
						encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology.</p>
					<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating
						environment that is not open to the public, we do not and cannot guarantee the security of your
						Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a
						manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you
						of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as
						reasonably possible and as permitted or required by law.</p>
					<h4>9. Controlling Your Personal Information</h4>
					<p>If you are a registered user of the Platform, you can modify some of the Personal Information you
						have included in your profile or change your username by logging in and accessing your account.
						If you wish to close your account, please email us at customer-info@getvitalcheck.com. Klarion
						Wellness will delete your account and the related information at your request as soon as
						reasonably possible. Please note, however, that Klarion Wellness reserves the right to retain
						information from closed accounts, including to comply with law, prevent fraud, resolve disputes,
						enforce the Agreement and take other actions permitted by law.</p>
					<p>You must promptly notify us if any of your account data is lost, stolen or used without
						permission.</p>
					<h4>10. Links to Other Websites</h4>
					<p>The Services may contain links to third party websites with which Klarion Wellness has no
						affiliation. A link to a non-Klarion Wellness website does not mean that we endorse that
						website, the quality or accuracy of information presented on the non-Klarion Wellness website or
						the persons or entities associated with the non-Klarion Wellness website. If you decide to visit
						a third party website, you are subject to the privacy policy of the third party website as
						applicable and we are not responsible for the policies and practices of the third party website.
						We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your information to others.</p>
					<h4>11. Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>
					<p>The effective date of this Privacy Policy is set forth at the top of this webpage. We will notify
						you of any material change by posting notice on this webpage. Your continued use of the Platform
						and Services after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy.
						We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy
						practices. The amended Privacy Policy supersedes all previous versions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO
						FUTURE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST STOP USING THE SERVICES AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE
						OF SUCH CHANGES.</p>
